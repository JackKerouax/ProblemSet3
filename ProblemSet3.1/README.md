## Problem 3.1
- Create a file named `ProblemSet3.1.c`.
- Write a switch statement that translates pitch classes A through G, represented with character data type, into corresponding integer intervals. A note `'C'` should be `0` and a note `'B'` should be  11. (*Hint: Chapter 0 in the Audio Programming Book)
- Print the result using `printf`.

In this problem I used the switch statement that detects the decimal number of capital letter A through Z, with C equals 0 and B equals 11.

However, I wasn't able to make a switch statement that can include accidentals in the letter such as C# or Db.
