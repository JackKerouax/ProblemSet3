## Problem 3.2
- Create a file named `ProblemSet3.2.c`.
- Include `math.h` in the program.
- Use the `sin` function and `for` loop to generate a single cycle (period) of a sine wave. The loop should stop when the increment variable reaches 1000. The phase of the sine wave should increment every step until it reaches 2Ï€ radians. (*Hint: Chapter 1.9.2 in the Audio Programming book)
- Use `printf` to print out the value of sine wave every step.

in this problem, I used the for loop with 1000 steps to calculate and print out the sin value of a circle from 0 to 2pi radian.
